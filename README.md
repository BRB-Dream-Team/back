# Server Setup Guide
This guide provides detailed instructions on how to set up and start the server using Docker Compose and environment variables.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

> Docker (version 27.0.3 or later)

> Docker Compose (version 2.28.1 or later)

> Git (optional, for version control)

## Getting Started

Clone the repository:
 
`git clone https://github.com/%username%/%repo%.git`

`cd %project-name%`

Create `.env` file in the root directory of your project with the variable names from `.env.sample`:

```
touch .env 
/
cp .env.sample .env
```

Open the `.env` file and add your environment variables. Adjust these variables according to your specific requirements.

## Configuration
Modify the docker compose file to match your project structure and requirements.

## Starting the Server
To start the server, follow these steps:

* Open terminal and navigate to your project directory.
* Build the Docker images (if you've made changes to the Dockerfile):
`docker-compose build`
* Start the services:
`docker-compose up -d`
> The -d flag runs the containers in detached mode.

Check if the containers are running:
`docker-compose ps`

View the logs (optional):
`docker-compose logs -f`
> The -f flag follows the log output.

## Stopping the Server

To stop the server:

* If you're following the logs, press `Ctrl+C` to exit.
* Run the following command:
`docker-compose down`

> This stops and removes the containers, networks, and volumes created by up.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues:

* Check the logs for error messages:
`docker-compose logs`

Ensure all required environment variables are set in the `.env` file.
Verify that the ports specified in `docker-compose.yml` are not already in use.
If changes to the `Dockerfile` or `docker-compose.yml` are not reflected, make sure to rebuild your docker containers:
```
docker-compose down
docker-compose up --build -d
```

## Maintenance

Regularly update your Docker images:
```
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up --build -d
```

> Back up your data regularly, especially if you're using volumes for persistent storage.
